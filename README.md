# Vim Fountain (CONT'D)

Two wonderful Fountain Plugins for Vim have been unmaintained for years:
* [Vim-Fountain](https://github.com/vim-scripts/fountain.vim)
  A syntax highlighter for Fountain Files
* [FountainFlow](https://github.com/vim-scripts/fountainflow.vim)
  A Fountain Exporter written in VimScript

This project combines the functionality of the two and extends them, where possible.
